# CAH_Secretary

CAH Secretary is a Discord Bot made for College Admissions Hub, a Discord server for High School Students, College Applicants, Undergrads, Alumni, and more.
It currently supports features such as:
* A Welcome Message within the default channel for each new member, a direct message linking the new member to a short quiz on the rules of the server
* A dynamic .roles command that lists out all of the available roles for self-assigning
* .role and .derole commands that allow users to self-assign and remove roles
